# Docker Compose control Discord bot

This Discord bot is able to control a local Docker-compose based environment.
It can start and stop it, and also send events based on the logs of the container.

It's technically a Valheim bot right now, with ability to notify on player join/leave.
But I'm trying to keep the code as re-usable as possible.

It's still a work in progress (and a huge mess) but works for my use case already.
If you decide to use it you're on your own.
